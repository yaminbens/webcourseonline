This Book holds the Welcome page at it's root, which is the main page users will see when accessing the Book website. All other files that appear under the chapter section will be included in the book in the same order. Files that are not mentioned in the table of contents will not appear as part of the Book, while still being acessible in edit mode and in the Github repository.\n",
